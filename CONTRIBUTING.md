## 🏗️ Project Structure (High-Level)

* `src/` – Svelte UI and core application logic
* `electron/` – Electron main and preload processes
* `public/` – Static assets
* `scripts/` – Build and utility scripts

Try to keep changes scoped and modular.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

* Test your changes on at least one platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
* Verify paths load, save, and export correctly
* Avoid introducing UI lag or frame drops
* If adding simulation logic, validate against known robot constraints

Automated testing is evolving—manual validation is currently important.

---

## 🎨 UI & UX Guidelines

* Maintain the existing color semantics:

  * Green = Paths
  * Amber = Waits
  * Pink = Rotations
* Prefer clarity over visual novelty
* Avoid unnecessary dialogs or modal overload
* Keep workflows keyboard-friendly where possible

---

## 🔧 Coding Standards

* Favor readability and maintainability
* Avoid premature optimization
* Use descriptive variable and function names
* Keep commits focused and meaningful

Commit messages should be clear and concise:

```
Add path optimizer boundary check
Fix telemetry desync on timeline scrub
```

---

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
   `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`
3. Commit your changes
   `git commit -m "Describe your change"`
4. Push to your fork
   `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`
5. Open a Pull Request against `main`

Please include:

* What the PR changes
* Why it’s needed
* Any known limitations or follow-ups

---

## 🔌 Plugins

If contributing a plugin:

* Keep it self-contained
* Avoid hard dependencies on internal state where possible
* Document installation and usage
* Follow the same quality and UX standards as core features
