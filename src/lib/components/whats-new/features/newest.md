### **Split Path**

You can now split a path segment into two separate segments at the current timeline position.

- **Precise Editing:** Easily insert new points or adjust specific sections of your path without affecting the rest.
- **How to use:** Position the timeline scrubber where you want to split, then press **`K`** (default keybind).
- **Seamless:** The path geometry is preserved, and you can immediately start editing the new segment.
