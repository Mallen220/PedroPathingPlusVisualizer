### What's New!

**Features:**

- **Event Markers for Rotations:** You can now add event markers to rotation steps in the timeline, just like you can for paths and waits. These markers are visualized with a circular arrow in the timeline.
- **Enhanced "What's New" Dialog:**
  - **Search:** Quickly find specific features or documentation using the new search bar.
  - **Release Notes:** Browse the full history of changes in the new "Release Notes" view.
  - **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press `Shift + N` to quickly open the "What's New" dialog.
- **Path Optimization:** Automatically optimize your paths using a genetic algorithm.
  - **Minimize Time:** Adjusts control points to find the fastest route while avoiding obstacles.
  - **Obstacle Avoidance:** Ensures the optimized path does not collide with defined obstacles.
- **Code Exporting:** Generate and export your path code in multiple formats.
  - **Java & Sequential:** Export as standard Java code or sequential commands for `SolversLib` or `NextFTC`.
  - **Points & JSON:** Export raw point data or the full project structure.
  - **Search:** Built-in search to quickly find specific lines in the generated code.
- **Path Validation:** Automatic checks for common issues.
  - **Collisions:** Alerts you if your path intersects with any obstacles.
  - **Zero-Length Segments:** Identifies and warns about segments that have no length.
- **File Management:** A built-in file manager to organize your paths.
  - **Browse & Organize:** View, rename, duplicate, and delete path files directly within the app.
  - **Import/Export:** Easily import existing paths or export your current work.
- **New Documentation:** Added comprehensive guides for Event Markers, Exporting Code, File Management, Obstacles, Path Optimization, Path Editing, Settings, and Simulation.
- **Improved Keyboard Navigation:** Extensive new shortcuts for navigating focus and manipulating selections, making it easier to use the app without a mouse.
- **Simulation Improvements:**
  - **Rotation Duration:** The simulation now accurately accounts for the time required to perform 'Rotate' commands, providing a more realistic total path time.
- **User Interface:**
  - **Standardized Inputs:** Input fields for 'Wait' and 'Rotate' commands now use consistent labels and placeholders.
