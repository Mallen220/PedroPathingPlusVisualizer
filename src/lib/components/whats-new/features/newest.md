### What's New!

## **Features:**

### **Path Optimizer**
- **Automatic Tuning:** Use the new genetic algorithm optimizer to automatically adjust control points for the fastest possible path.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The optimizer respects obstacles and finds paths that navigate around them.
- **Preview & Apply:** Review the optimized path and compare stats before applying changes.

### **Path Validation**
- **Real-time Checks:** Instantly detect collisions with obstacles and zero-length path segments.
- **Visual Feedback:** Problematic areas are highlighted directly on the field with clear markers.
- **Safety First:** Ensure your path is valid and safe before running it on the robot.

### **Path Statistics**
- **Deep Insights:** Analyze your path with detailed charts for velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity.
- **Segment Breakdown:** View precise metrics for every segment of your path.
- **Performance Warnings:** Get alerts for potential issues like wheel slip or exceeding velocity limits.

### **Telemetry Import**
- **Log Visualization:** Import CSV or JSON telemetry logs to see your robot's actual path on the field.
- **Ghost Robot:** Compare your planned path with the actual robot motion using a "ghost" overlay.
- **Sync Tools:** Adjust time offsets to perfectly align telemetry data with your simulation.
