### What's New in 1.7.2!

## **Features:**

### **Configurable Telemetry**

- **Your Choice**: Select your preferred telemetry backend for Java generated code.
- **Options**: Choose between **FTC Dashboard**, **Panels**, **Standard** (Driver Station), or **None**. Future support planned for the **PPP Visualizer** backend.
- **Easy Switching**: Change this setting in **Settings > Auto Export** or via the **Quick Settings** in the Code tab.

### **Export & Workflow**

- **Direct Download**: Download generated code as a `.java` file directly from the Code tab using the toolbar or `Cmd/Ctrl + J` (also available via a keybind when the Code tab is active).
- **Quick Copy**: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C` to copy generated code and `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T` to copy the waypoint table (keybinds work when the relevant tab is focused).
- **Smart Filenames**: The downloader automatically suggests a filename based on your project.

### **Live Code Preview (recommended)**

- **Real-time Code Generation**: See your Java code update instantly as you modify your path.
- **Smart Diff View**: Additions are highlighted in green and removals in red, making it easy to track changes.
- **Enable It**: Enable **Auto Export Code** in **Settings > Auto Export** to open the **Code** tab and use the live preview. This is the recommended workflow for immediate feedback.

### **Follow Robot Mode & Field Renderer**

- **Automatic Camera Tracking**: The field view now follows your robot during playback, keeping the action centered.
- **Field Renderer Integration**: Camera following is implemented in the field renderer and respects manual user input.
- **Seamless Control**: Manually panning or zooming temporarily pauses tracking; tracking resumes automatically when playback restarts or can be toggled.
- **Enable It**: Toggle **Follow Robot** in **Settings > Interface > Follow Robot**.

### **Smart Object Snapping**

- **Improved Waypoint Placement**: Field waypoints now support smart object snapping to make precise placements easier.
- **Opt-out**: Snap behavior can be disabled at **Settings > Interface > Smart Snapping**.

### **Keybindings & Accessibility**

- **Keyboard-first UI**: The toolbar is fully keyboard-accessible with enhanced focus indicators.
- **Keybind Hints**: Buttons and table actions now show keyboard shortcut hints in tooltips.
- **Global Shortcuts**: New keybindings added for quick actions (copy code/table, download `.java`) that are active when the corresponding tab is focused.

### **Other Changes & Fixes**

- **Default Port**: Changed default port from `34567` to `17218` (network / auto-export listeners updated accordingly).
- **Security**: Several critical security fixes have been applied. Please update to this release as soon as possible.
- **Quick fix**: Project rename to **pedro-pathing-plus-visualizer** applied across the project ✅
