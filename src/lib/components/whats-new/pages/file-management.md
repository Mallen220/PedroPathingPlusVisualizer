# File Management

The Pedro Pathing Visualizer uses a local file management system to store your projects as `.pp` files. This allows for secure storage, easy version control, and organized project management.

## Opening and Saving Files

- **Open File**: Click the "Files" button in the top left corner to open the file manager. From there, you can browse your saved projects and click to open one.
- **Save File**: Use `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on macOS) to save your current project. If it's a new project, you'll be prompted to name it.
- **Save As**: You can duplicate or rename files within the file manager to create copies.

## Organizing Files

The file manager allows you to:

- **Create New Files**: Click "New File" in the file manager toolbar.
- **Delete Files**: Click the trash icon next to a file to delete it.
- **Rename Files**: Click the pencil icon to rename a file.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to filter files by name.
- **Sort**: Sort files by name or date modified.
- **Change Directory**: By default, files are saved in an `auto_paths` directory in your documents. You can change this directory in the file manager settings.

## Importing and Exporting

- **Import**: You can import `.pp` files from other locations by dragging them into the application or using the import button in the file manager.
- **Export**: While `.pp` files are the native format, you can also export your paths as Java code, JSON, or sequential commands for use in your robot code. See the [Exporting](/exporting) page for more details.
